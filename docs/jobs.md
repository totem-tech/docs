# Careers 

Current jobs available at Totem Live Accounting:

## Administrative Roles

### Personal Assistant to the CEO.

This role is a critical to the success of the company and we are looking for our own Donna. Ideally you will have a background as an executive assistant in Law, Private Equity, Venture Capital, or other professional bodies but are looking to employ your considerable skills to fulfil your ambitions.

You will be the CEO's right hand and are expected to be always one step ahead. You need to be a creative thinker, and know how to get things done, hold back the tide and generally organise things to run smoothly. It goes without say you should have a network of reliable sources.

### Project and Release Manager.

This role requires organisational skills to make sure our repos are being maintained with various milestones, labels and tags and gathering information from the team on progress and feedback. This is a key role to ensure that everyone is aware of progress and where we are headed, what needs to be done in the short term. You will be required to understand that sometimes delivery dates may slip, and be prepared to keep the ship going in the right direction. You will report to the Founders.

### Internship.

It helps if you love breaking things because this is a key role supporting the development effort. Our app is live, and new functionality is being built all the time, and we need someone who is not afraid to try things directly in our live app, test, break things, raise issues, make recomendations on the UX and help contribute towards documenting how everything works. You may be familiar with coding and tools like mdbook, gitlab/github but they are not essential. More importantly you should be enthusiastic and excited to learn.

### Speculative Application

You tell us why we should hire you!

## Developer Roles

### Web Developer

Totem Live's app front-end is built with React and Javascript with that in mind you should have these skills and be able to hit the ground running. Your initial task is to rebuild our website but following that you will join our dev team to work on improving the UI.

### More than a Rust Developer

This is a critical role working alongside the CEO (also a Rust dev) to develop the blockchain modules that support the entire application. You must be more than a developer though, able to research and understand the accounting flow and how Totem solves many of the existing problems that accounting software has. Building tests is also a must and familiarity with Substrate from Parity is helpful but not essential.

### Network Infrastructure VPS Architect

We are looking for a seasoned professional to help running and setting up network infrastructure to support the launch and network. Experience in handling and mitigating DOS and other possible attacks, as well as setting up stable and reliable architectures on various VPS platforms and OSes. You should also contribute towards "How-to..." documentation to encourage external parties to host nodes on the network. Familiarity with linux, nginx, docker is a must.

## Communications Roles

### Website Designer

You want to design a user experience for our website that is clean, modern, spacious, easy to read and navigate. You will be working closely with the Website Copywriter and you will be expected to come up with visuals and illustrations where necessary. Once the design is finalised you will work with the Web Developer to realise the new site using the any high quality elements you have produced. 

### Website Copywriter

You will need to take several diverse sources of information about Totem (original mission paper, exec  summary, discussions with founders, road map and other information), and boil them down into byte-sized (pun intended) copy that communicates the main goals of the project. More importantly it must target the needs of investors explaining the investment opportunity in clear terms and providing the information and links they need.

### Social Media Communications

You will be active in social media and be working in a team to encourage growth and sign-ups from the community at large. Our main aim it to make "Totem Live Accounting" a brand everyone is talking about. You  will be responsible for community moderation and compiling answers to FAQs as you discover them. You will report to the Marketing Manager and CEO.

### Language Translators

We have a number of sources of information that we need translated into as many languages as possible. If you are a non-native English speaker (but of course are fluent in English) and can translate we would love to hear from you.
