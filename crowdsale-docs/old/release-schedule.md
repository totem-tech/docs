### BTC Release Schedule per Multiplier Level

This table shows the total overall TOTEM that can be released over the 12 month release calendar by Multiplier Level. 

> **This table is defined by the principle that the lowest level Contributors are not penalised over the higher level Contributors as only 162% of the contributed funds can be released prior to MainNet. A staggered release period applies at all levels above the lowest level.**

Remaining balances on accounts are transferred to MainNet.

An additional multiplier (exact value to be decided) will be applied on MainNet under the conditions outlined in the [FAQ - Are HODLers Penalised?](crowdsale-docs/crowdsale-faq.md?id=_4-are-hodlers-penalised).
