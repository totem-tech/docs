### Totem Transactions will mostly be viewed as an investment opportunity by the majority of the Crowdsale participants. 

**However it is our intention that these participants will have a greater responsibility in the MainNet: _to maintain liquidity in order for the network users to be able to use Totem_.**

> In MainNet users of Totem Live Accounting need to have XTX to pay for transactions. They will acquire XTX from the participants in the Crowdsale who are custodians of the majority of tokens issued.

The quantity of XTX released on MainNet is dependent future releases of the Network, following usage and robust testing. The long-term view is that 49% of XTX tokens will be distributed to the Crowdsale participants, and other Contributors and the remainder to the network treasury.

The network treasury will be the liquidity provider of last resort and on-chain governance will determine by votes, how those funds are released.
