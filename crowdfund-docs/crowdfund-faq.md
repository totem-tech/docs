## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Can I sell TOTEM after the Crowdfunding?

**Yes.** 

Depending on which contribution level you acheived some of your allocation maybe be locked until MainNet Launch, but most of it will be released in the 12 months following the end of the Crowdfunding. See the Schedules for details.

We already have the basis for a cross-chain OTC Marketplace available in the Totem Live App, and we aim to have it completed shortly after the Crowdfunding. This will allow you to exchange TOTEM for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dots and possibly other cryptocurrencies.

It does not preclude exchanges from listing TOTEM where you may be able to exchange your released funds against any cryptocurrency.

### 2. Can I get free tokens?

**Yes.** 

A limited supply of free tokens is available from our faucet **before the Crowdfunding starts**. There are several ways to obtain them:

**Refer a friend.** 

If your friend signs up they will automatically receive the standard sign-up allocation plus a small bonus. You will also receive a bonus for referring. 

**Using Totem**

Totem is designed to be used. If you use Totem for tasks, activities and timekeeping as well as payments, your account will receive an additional bonus allocation of TOTEM on MainNet. The more you use Totem the greater the allocation on MainNet. Remember the Developers will not be holding TOTEM and the idea is that the majority of TOTEM must be distributed to the community. So get to work!

### 3. What happens to funds allocated from the faucet?

* **3.1** If you receive funds from the faucet and use these funds to work with Totem TestNets, then you will receive an allocation on MainNet. You will also be in line for an additional bonus allocation as a "thankyou" for helping us improve our product before going live. 

* **3.2** If you receive funds from the faucet and do nothing, then no matter how large your balance, no funds will be allocated on MainNet. HODLing serves no purpose in Totem TestNets as the price is deterministic, but you can realise value by using the tokens yourself.

* **3.3** If you receive funds from the faucet and attempt "simulate usage" for example by only transfering funds between Identities you will receive zero allocations of TOTEM on MainNet. This would be pretty dumb anyway because you burn transaction fees in the process.

### 4. Are HODLers penalised?

**Yes, no, it is contingent.**

We want to encourage people to use Totem because it helps us define product market fit. So we have a couple of rules that determine how your funds migrate to MainNet:

* **4.1** If you receive funds from Crowdfunding, and actually use Totem, then this will cause your balance to be reduced. To make up for this you will be recompensated in MainNet with an additional bonus based on the amount of usage on top of your original allocation. The amount is to be decided.

    * **4.11** A cut-off period will come into play to determine the account activity and the amount of TOTEM that will be allocated on MainNet. This will be notified to all users in advance.

* **4.2** If you receive funds from Crowdfunding, and do nothing, you will be allocated the same quantity of TOTEM on MainNet.

* **4.3** If you receive funds from Crowdfunding, and sell some, but do no other activity in Totem you will be allocated the remaining quantity of TOTEM on MainNet.


### 5. Is this an Initial Parachain Offering?

Although Totem is part of the Polkadot Ecosystem, a so-called Initial Parachain Offering is designed to lock funds for the _Contributors_ and not the developers. This is a funding round is designed to grow the team and accelerate development towards MainNet.

Having said that, we will be encouraging the Polkadot Community to appraise the project against other projects in the space and invest in our parachain auction slot when the time is right. This will only be after Totem Live Accounting's MainNet launch.

### 6. When I contribute how many confirmations do I have to wait for?

With any cryptocurrency payment, there are factors that can mean that your funds are not immediately allocated, perhaps because the funds were not included in a block in a timely manner.

In our registration form you will be required to click to confirm that funds have been sent and from that point on we will monitor the blockchains for your funds. This is an automated process and your funds should be credited within 24 hours following at least 12 confirmations on any network. 

If your funds are not credited after 24 hours, you can trigger a further manual status check in the registration form.

### 7. What happens if I pay after the Crowdfunding is closed?

You contributions will be counted, but you will not achieve multipliers no matter how much you have contributed. If this is the case TOTEM will be allocated at a 1:1 value level for the cryptocurrrency you paid with.

### 8. When will my total allocations be calculated?

Mostly this will be in the weeks following the Crowdfunding to allow for any late payments.

### 9. Can I pay with Fiat?

**No.**

### 10. Is there a maximum contribution?

**Yes unless over subscribed**

The maximum contribution is determined by the maximum number of TOTEM that is available for allocation. This is known as the Crowdfunding Target Cap. If the Live Accounting Association judges that the Crowdfunding is over-subscribed, it can at its own discretion increase the quantity of TOTEM to be allocated.

* **10.1 How much is the Crowdfunding Cap?**

> The Crowdfunding Soft Cap is equivalent to 100M units of TOTEM or $3.5M.
> The Crowdfunding Targte Cap is equivalent to 100M units of TOTEM or $3.5M.

We do not expect this to be reached, and in any case the remaining funds will not be carried over to MainNet.

### 11. Can I invest more than the Level 8 Multiplier?

**Yes**

Contact us to discuss.

### 12. How can we contact you?

We have a dedicated support channel already built into Totem Live.

Ping us and we should respond. 

**Please note:** We are a small team, and we do sleep from time-to-time but you will receive a response. Keep checking back.
