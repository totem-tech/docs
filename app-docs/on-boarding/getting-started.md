## What is the Getting Started Module?

> The **Getting Started Module** is primarily the module used for on-boarding. 

Users who have not visited Totem Live Accounting before, will need to go through **two simple steps to set-up their accounts** and a third step to make their first backup.

_The backup function is managed in this module and you can return to it at any time to back-up your data._
