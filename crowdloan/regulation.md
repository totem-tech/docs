# Regulation, The Howey Test and Swiss FINMA

In this section we detail the two most important considerations; the so-called **"Howey Test"** and **Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance** in relation to the Crowdloan or Pledge. 

In addition as the Live Accounting Association, based in Switzerland is administering the Crowdloan or Pledge and must follow the Swiss Financial Market's Authority Guidance which is outlined below.

## The Howey Test 

The Howey Test which came out of the 1946 Securities and Exchange Commission Court Case  [Howey vs SEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_v._W._J._Howey_Co.) has become widely accepted as  being applicable to all cryptocurrency fundraising efforts since 2017. 

The purpose of the Howey Test is to determine if the Crowdloan or Pledge constitutes an "investment contract".

The Howey Test is set out in four parts. All four parts need to be passed in order for the distribution of Tokens to be considered an "investment contract" and therefore as a security. If one or more parts fail, then the Token _may not_ be considered a security in most jurisdictions.

If the Token is deemed to be a security (i.e. it passes all four tests), then the sale must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the USA, regardless of the country in which the Token sale occurs.

The four parts of the test are broadly:

* Is there an investment of money?
* Is there a so-called "Common Enterprise"?
* Is there an expectation of profits or returns on investment?
* Do returns rely solely on the efforts of others?

In the following sections we detail how these tests apply to this Crowdloan or Pledge. Please read this very carefully, and if you have any questions you may reach out to us on any channel for clarification.


### ANALYSIS 1: Is there an investment of money?

The Totem Live Accounting Test Network (aka Totem Meccano Canary Network) is a public blockchain network that has been live since February 14th 2019, and has been the backbone of all the development work that has taken place before and after it was launched.

All users who have registered on the [Totem Live App](https://totem.live) connect directly with the network and have been allocated Totem Network Coins (ticker symbol: TOTEM) - the native cryptocurrency of the network - for free using our automated Faucet since the outset.

The Totem Live Accounting Blockchain Network does not depend on other blockchains such as Ethereum or Bitcoin - it is completely decentralised and independent.

TOTEM is consumed in order to execute actions on the Totem Live Accounting Network. For example to create Activities, Timekeeping and Tasks and to administer them requires you to spend TOTEM to process these requests on the blockchain network.

Furthermore all existing users since launch have also been able to request, with certain limits, further allocations of Transactions (ticker symbol: TOTEM) from the Faucet without charge. This request is carried out from within the application itself. These additional allocations have been fixed at the same level as the initial allocation and have been distributed free-of-charge.

The allocations made to users will be conditionally carried over to the Totem KAPEX Parachain as a reward for early adopters.

The Totem Network Coins Token (ticker symbol: TOTEM) is a cryptocurrency that has never been intended to have a value determined by after-market exchanges. 

TOTEM has been designed from the outset to have a value that is calculated deterministically by an automated algorithm as set out in our 2016 Paper and more recently updated. The algorithm determines the value of TOTEM based on information available tothe Totem Network. 

The concept provides that the value of the Token cannot be manipulated by external parties and allows accounting entries to be made with a Unit of Account of deterministic value rather than a currency of floating value. This primarily enables accounting operations to be recorded with the Unit of Account and not the market price.

It should be noted that as the Totem Live Accounting Network is a permissionless blockchain network, no party can prevent after-market exchanges from listing TOTEM. 

However users of third-party exchanges should be aware that the spot price (or market price) is completely disconnected from the deterministicly calculated price in the Totem Live Accounting Network, and therefore users must consider and are entirely responsible for impairment risks when selling or buying on after-market exchanges.

The value of the TOTEM allocated by the Faucet is in accordance with the valuation algorithm. At the time of the network start, this value was equivalent to around 0.18 USD at a time of allocation or 16181 TOTEM. 

This amount is sufficient for micro-business to conduct accounting operations and business activities in the Totem Live Accounting Application essentially for free for a meaningful period of time without requiring an investment of fiat or cryptocurrency funds.

In the case of a requested to replenish TOTEM, the Faucet allocated the funds unconditionally and for free although this will partially change in future as outlined here.

Whilst the Tokens have been distributed by the Faucet prior to the users of the Meccano Test Network, the entire remaining balances held by the Founders will be transferred to the Live Accounting Association, an independent non-profit organisation based in Switzerland. This will be carried out with one-off network reset which will not penalise other existing holders. These funds will not be carried over to the Totem KAPEX Network.

The Crowdloan & Pledge will be administered by the Live Accounting Association, and the basis of the allocation will be that the TOTEM Tokens will be distributed as a measure of the contribution to the Crowdloan and as a pledged donation to the to the Founders. The donation does not constitute or confer membership of the Association, which can be obtained seperately. 

The Live Accounting Association will set aside money received as a donation to enable the purpose of the Association.

> The purpose of the Live Accounting Association is to provide funding for the development of the Live Accounting Network. Any developer - not just the Founders of Totem Accounting - can apply for grants from the Association for work that carries out the purpose of the Association.

* Founders and staff will receive an allocation of KAPEX from the Live Accounting Treasury.

* In future all balances will be transferred to Totem Live Accounting MainNet at a minimum of 1:1 ratio of allocation TOTEM to KAPEX. 

#### Howey Test 1 Conclusion 

The first test is unlikely to be satified as Totem Network Coins (ticker symbol: TOTEM) were distributed on an already live network via an already live application, for free and for a significant period of time prior the Crowdloan or Pledge.

Therefore on this point the Token does not qualify as a Security. Consideration must still be given to the other tests.

---

### ANALYSIS 2: Is there a so-called "Common Enterprise"?

As the Totem Live Accounting Network has already been developed and is already live, there is no requirement for the Contributors to the Crowdloan or Pledge to be part of a common enterprise in order for the project to be developed, launched or to succeed.

The KAPEX Coins are unlocked for Contributors shortly after the Crowdloan & Pledge activates using the blockchain application itself. 

Contributors can immediately use some or all of their allocations of KAPEX to enable the application or to transfer to other parties as a form of settlement at the market exchange rate. 

#### Howey Test 2 Conclusion

The second test fails to establish a common enterprise, as Contributors are participating after the application has been developed and available to use.

---

### ANALYSIS 3. Is there an expectation of profits or returns on investment?

There are three categories of Totem Transaction owners:

* Early users / owners who were allocated TOTEM from tne Totem Meccano Faucet and will receive KAPEX on the Totem KAPEX Network.
* Crowdloan or Pledge Contributors owners who were allocated KAPEX as a function of their contribution
* Owners who are both of the above

For users allocated Totem Network Coins (ticker symbol: TOTEM) from the Meccano Faucet alone there is no expectation of profit. No publicity has ever been made to this effect at any time.

KAPEX that is allocated by the Live Accounting Association in the Crowdloan or Pledge is allocated at a fixed exchange rate plus bonuses on a like for like basis plus bonuses which could be considered discounts.

#### Howey Test 3 Conclusion 

If the Howey Test was based on this test alone there would be a possibility that the discount allocation is considered a security, but this is not guaranteed for all contributors. 

This test is therefore only partially satisfied and subject to interpretation.

---

### ANALYSIS 4. Do returns rely solely on the efforts of others?

In traditional so-called Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) the project is just an idea. At the point of the ICO the application has not been developed yet, and may fail if the development team is not able to achieve their goals. In these cases it is clear that investments in ICOs would require others to do work in order to realise a profit or return.

The Totem Accounting development team has been entirely Founder-funded until this point and the project began some time in 2016. There are no external investors and never has been. 

The Totem Accounting development team have developed the blockchain network and the core functionality of the application before beginning a funding round. 

Potential Investors are in a vastly different position with Totem Live Accounting as they can make valid judgements about the Team and its abilities based on what they have achieved and delivered to-date. 

The contributions they make are aimed at providing funds to accelerate the development of the remaining aspects of the application and to begin the process of adoption.

In essence Totem Live Accounting, isn't an idea any more. It's no longer even an MVP. It's a long way down the road to becoming a full product. 

Furthermore because the entire development is completely opensource, any party can join the network, build their own applications and User Interfaces without having to rely on the Founding Team.

#### Test 4 Conclusion 

The Founding Team has already completed the work to enable the network. It is no longer dependent on their efforts to function or operate. However, it is dependent on their vision and credibility to accelerate the goal towards widespread adoption.

The network is already functional, the code is open source, and the documentation about the project aims are is in the public domain. 

These facts alone mean that the Howey Test is not satified that the enterprise relies on the efforts of others to continue. 

---

## Howey Test Conclusions

Long before the Crowdloan & Pledge, the Totem Live Accounting Network and Application became public and operational with the core functionality having already been built, launched and available to the public even in the Test Network form.

Furthermore TOTEM has been issued and distributed for a significant period of time prior to the Crowdloan & Pledge for free and will continue to allocated in this way, albeit in some limited capacity as the new coin KAPEX, after the Crowdloan or Pledge completes via Airdrops and community engagement.

The users of the Network are not required to carry out work in order to give value to the Token as the value is determined by an independent algorithm rather than a third-party market price. 

The application has almost entirely been completed by the Founders prior to the Crowdloan & Pledge and can be used today although there are still many parts to be added.

This analysis is subject to alternative interpretation however for the reasons set out above three out of the four tests fail and on this basis the Totem Transaction Token (ticker symbol: TOTEM or KAPEX) is unlikely to considered a security in the USA.

This opinion may change in future or should the legislation change.

# Swiss FINMA Regulations

Under the Swiss Markets authority Guidance (FINMA Guidance 04/2017), Totem Network Coins (ticker symbol: TOTEM) may fall under one or several categories of Token:

* A Payment Token
* A Registered or Unregistered Security Token
* An Asset Token

The categorisation is not mutually exclusive and can be cumulative.

A further categorization is possible, the so-called Pre-Sale or Pre-Financing of a project. In the case of TOTEM which is already in circulation this categorisation is not applicable.

### ANALYSIS 5. Are Totem Network Coins Payment Tokens?

Totem Network Coins (ticker symbol: TOTEM) are in the classic sense a cryptocurrency. They are intended to be consummed when transactions are executed on the blockchain network, and can be used for payments. The quantity of TOTEM that is consumed by a transaction depends on the byte size of the transaction and other technical factors including the type of accounting record to be stored on the blockchain.

However, unlike traditional cryptocurrencies the value of TOTEM is deterministic, as it is designed to be used as a Unit of Account within the accounting engine. In this case the value that is recorded may not have any bearing on a specific blockchain transaction, and may not even be related to an asset that is held.

#### Test 5 Conclusion

Totem Network Coins (ticker symbol: TOTEM) are defined as a cryptocurrency and given the nature of the value calculation, will inevitably be used as a settlement currency although this mechanism was primarily designed as a Unit of Account for valuation and accounting purposes. 

TOTEM and by implication KAPEX can be considered a Payment Token and is therefore not treated as a security in this context. 

---

### ANALYSIS 6. Are Totem Network Coins Utility Tokens?

By definition Totem Network Coins (TOTEM and KAPEX) are Utility Tokens whose purpose is to confer digital access rights to the blockchain network.

Furthermore they are not intended to be traded as a free-floating asset on capital markets, although KAPEX will have free-floating value on the cryptocurrency markets.

#### Test 6 Conclusion

In this case the Totem Network Coins (ticker symbol: TOTEM) exhibit missing properties that would otherwise class it as a security, for example to provide access to capital markets.

---

### ANALYSIS 7. Are Totem Network Coins Asset Tokens?

Totem Network Coins (ticker symbol: TOTEM) that are to be distributed on an existing so-called TestNet system. They are intended to be migrated to the Totem KAPEX Parachain network when it goes live. 

The allocation is conditional upon the contributor to comply with the terms of migration, but in general remaining balances on accounts will be migrated plus any additional bonuses earned in the interim.

The KAPEX Tokens are standardised and they are not intended for mass standardised trading.

Totem Network Coins have been self-issued since April 2019 and although it has not been publicised, given the fact that a Crowdloan & Pledge will occur there may be an expectation of a claim on the KAPEX Parachain Network for non-paying Contributors from the Meccano Network.

#### Test 7 Conclusion

Totem Network Coins (ticker symbol: TOTEM and migrated or earned KAPEX) may be considered uncertificated securities under the Swiss Stock Exchange Act (SESTA). Self-issued uncertificated securities in Switzerland are esentially unregulated even if uncertificated securities qualify as securities within the meaning of the Financial Market Infrastructure Act (FIMIA). 

Totem Network Coins (ticker symbol: TOTEM and migrated or earned KAPEX) are not intended to be traded on the Primary [Stock] Market and therefore do not need to be regulated in accordance with directives in Article 3 paragrah 3 [Stock Exchange Ordinance] of SESTA.

The issuance of Totem Network Coins are not analgous to Equity or Bonds and although FINMA has no direct responsibility in this area, the Token is not required to conform to the Swiss Code of Obligations and the Financial Services Act (FINSA).

---

### ANALYSIS 8. Other considerations under Swiss Regulations

#### Deposits

This issuance of Totem Network Coins by the Live Accounting Association in exchange does not constitute a claim for the repayment of funds, and therefore the contributions are not considered deposits. There is no requirement under the Banking Act to require a licence. 

#### Collective Investment Schemes

The funds collected by the Live Accounting Association are not to be managed by third parties and are therefore is not a collective investment scheme.

# KYC and AML Regulations

In Switzerland in the case of utility tokens anti-money laundering regulation is not applicable as long as the main reason for issuing the tokens is to provide access rights to a non-financial application of blockchain technology (see Art. 2 para. 2 let. a no. 3 AMLO, FINMA Circ. 11/1 "Financial intermediation under AMLA" margin no. 13 et seq.).
