# How to Contribute

### Step 1: Sign-up on the Totem Live App. 

Create your Totem chat user ID and blockchain Identity. Your funds will be sent to your Identity. 

You will be prompted to backup your account - do not skip this step and keep your backup safe!

### Step 2: 

Open the Crowdsale Module, and complete the registration process.

You’ll need to select the crypto you wish to pay with, BTC ETH and DOT selectable directly in the app, but it is still possible to pay with any cryptocurrency. See the [Notes for expert users](/crowdsale-docs/crowdsale-how-to?id=note-for-expert-users-only).

For ETH, Totem  requires a whitelisted account for payment, in order to check the balance paid to the smart contract. The tokens issued by the smart contract on Ethereum are issued 1:1 with the ETH paid, and are intended as a counter. They are not intended to have a market price. The final balance will be taken as the token allocation * multiplier.
BTC DOT and KSM will have unique addresses per signup, in order to monitor the addresses. The final balance on these addresses will be taken as the token allocation * multiplier.

### Step 3: 
### Step 4: 

After submitting the form, you’ll receive within 24-hours a Totem crowdsale account address (it will be specific to you and the crypto). You can execute payment to buy Totem xTx at any point during the crowdsale.

You can track your XTX in your Totem.Live account. The vesting period is time until MainNet launch, where your XTX on testnet will be part of the supply on MainNet.
