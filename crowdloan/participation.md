# Participating in the Crowdloan

---

Participating in the **Totem Parachain Crowdloan** is a great opportunity for early adopters and for fans of Polkadot - not only do you get to keep the DOTs you commit but you also get an equivalent value in KAPEX coins from Totem. There is no risk to your funds as the Crowdloan is secured by the Polkadot chain, and your DOT is returned to you if Totem does not win. **It's really that simple and really that safe.**


You will find an overview of the offering below and you can follow how to take part in the instructions available the [Links](#Links) section below. 

### Bonus Offering 

As none of the DOTs commited to the Parachain Slot Auction go to the development team, we are also offering a special enhanced commitment program that will help fund the launch of the Totem Live Accounting MainNet and accelerate our path to market. The good news is _you don't have to pay anything now_ because we are simply asking you to make a pledge to fund that process and will ask you to make good on that pledge and claim your bonus when the parachain Slot auction succeeds and we are ready with a module to manage your claims.

### What is a pledge?

**A pledge is a non-binding signal of intent.** Simply put, you will be signalling your intent to contribute to funding the team at a later date (tbd). You will not pay any money now, but in order to collect the bonus you will of course be expected to make good on your pledge. 

The pledge will be managed by Treasury of the Live Accounting Association by a special module created for the purpose and of course that will not be available until a parachain slot is won. 

**At no time will you ever be _obliged_ to meet the pledge you made - it is up to you. This is the fairest mechanism we can conceive to operate such a bonus scheme.**

### Already a Totem Meccano User?

If you have received funds from our Totem Testnet Faucet on the Meccano Network, you will automatically receive an allocation of KAPEX on the Polkadot Parachain. However, these funds are only claimable when Totem secures a parachain slot. We will provide instructions for you to do that once the slot is secure. Before this happens we will put Totem Meccano into "Maintenance Mode" to lock the current state of balances. You will be expected to claim your funds but they will never be lost.

### What is KAPEX? I thought Totem had the TOTEM coin?

In simple terms, KAPEX is a market priced coin used on the Polkadot Parachain. On MainNet TOTEM will be an algorithmic stable coin as described [in the Token Economics section](information/overview-token) of this docmentation website.

The relationship is quite simple: at this point in time we do not know how many TOTEM should be available to the MainNet network. We do not want to penalise early adopters by setting an amount that is too large. Instead the parachain and the KAPEX coin will help us determine exactly how many coins should be available in MainNet based on it's market capitalisation of KAPEX at the launch of MainNet.

KAPEX will help us precisely define the economic model by seeing how costly transactions are using a market price coin and to measure the optimal starting quantity of coins for MainNet. This is the main justification for creating KAPEX as a market coin.

#### How will the coins be migrated from KAPEX to MainNet?
Holders of KAPEX will be expected to burn their holding in order to receive/mint their allocation of TOTEM on MainNet. In this way, the market decides the market cap and effectively how many Totem they will get minted for MainNet. There will be incentives to burn the coins in order to bootstrap MainNet.

KAPEX holder in effect will be the liquidity providers to actual users on MainNet who will purchase TOTEM as utility tokens from these early adopters.

Shortly after launch of MainNet and provided it reaches stability thresholds the developers will relinquish control in MainNet and Totem will become community owned and governed.

## Parachain Crowdloan & The Pledge Allocations

### 1. Crowdloan

* If you only commit to the Parachain Slot Auction (Crowdloan) you will receive **40x** the quantity of DOT in **Totem KAPEX**.

To encourage Crowdloan support, if the community reaches the SoftCap contribution (2.5M DOT) every contributor will receive an 5% bonus. 
If the community reaches the HardCap contribution (12.5M DOT) every contributor will receive an 15% bonus.


You can stop at this point if you do not want to take part in **The Pledge**.

---

### 2. Pledge

**You can chose to pledge up to 10% of the quantity of DOT committed in the Parachain Slot Auction into our Crowdfund.**

As a reward for supporting the development team you will be able to claim a bonus multiplier of KAPEX based on the sum total amount you commited in the Parachain Slot Auction _and_ the amount you pledged in the Crowdfund. 

* By pledging an amount of DOT in the Crowdfund, you will be able to claim a multiplier of Totem KAPEX calculated as follows:

> **Ratio of commitments**:
>
> Total quantity of DOTs pledged in Crowdfund / Total quantity of DOTs committed in Parachain Slot Auction

> **Total DOTs**:
>
> Total quantity of DOTs pledged in Crowdfund + Total quantity of DOTs committed in Parachain Slot Auction

> **Multiplier**
>
> Total DOTs * (1 + Ratio of commitments) * 40

## Conditions of Participation

These conditions apply where relevant to either the Crowdloan or the Crowdfund or both. **If you chose to participate in both the Crowdloan and the Crowdfund, you must use the same Polkadot address for both actions** so that your KAPEX award can be calculated and awarded. We cannot make bonus calculations if you use separate addresses.

**Crowdloan Limits**
> * A soft cap on the Parachain Slot Auction Crowdloan is set to $100M [approx 2.5M DOT]
> * A hard cap on the Parachain Slot Auction Crowdloan is set at $500M [12.5M DOT]

**Crowdfund Pledge Limits**
> * A soft cap is set at $4M for the Crowdfund [100,000 DOT]
> * A hard cap is set at $50M [1.25M DOT]

**Supply Limits**
> Maximum KAPEX allocation Parachain Slot Auction and Crowdfunding:
> * **55% of total supply of KAPEX**
> * **i.e. 550,000,000 KAPEX**
>
> * Total Network Issuance 1,000,000,000 KAPEX

**Commitment Limits**
> * For the Parachain Slot Auction there are no upper or lower limits for participants.
> * A minimum commitment of 2.5 DOT is applied for the Pledge.
> * The Ratio of commitment is capped at 10% per address. 
>   * There is no benefit to over-pledging but you will be required to submit the correct amount to make the bonus claim.
>
> _There are implied limits to participation proportional to the Crowdloan limits and the Pledge limits set out above._

**Lock Periods**
> * The DOT contributed towards the Parachain Slot Auction are locked for the period of the parachain lease and can be reclaimed thereafter.
> * KAPEX is awarded if the parachain Slot auction is won, and will be carried out on chain.
> * A transaction lock will apply to all KAPEX awards for a period of time following a parachain win. This will give the team time to generate the funds and apply it to the participating Polkadot addresses. 
> * Once the allocations of KAPEX have been completed, transactions will be enabled. 

## Example

In the following table, Column A has committed & pledged the highest amount but the lowest ratio of commitments, Column B has not taken part in the Crowdfund, and Column C has the lowest amount committed, with the highest ratio of commitment.

This should give you a good idea as to how KAPEX is awarded.

| Description                         | A      | B      | C    |
