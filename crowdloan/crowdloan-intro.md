# Announcing the Totem Parachain Crowdloan.

### Totem Live Accounting Team is excited to announce that after more than two and a half year’s development in the Polkadot Ecosystem, we are ready for our Crowdloan offering for the upcoming Polkadot Parachain Slot Auctions.

If you have not seen these pages before, feel free to browse the Totem Live Accounting documentation links in the sidebar and visit our [Website](https://totemaccounting.com) and [Test Network App](https://totem.live).

## What is a Parachain?

A parachain is not a smart contract. It is a seperate blockchain network, that will connect to the Polkadot blockchain. 

Totem is such a blockchain. In order to connect to Polkadot Totem will pay for a lease - or a slot - for a fixed period of time. 

## Ok then, what is Polkadot?

Polkadot is also a blockchain. However because of its relationship to the other blockchains that will connect to it, Polkadot is often referred to as a Relay Chain, or Layer 0 chain. 

It provides a number of important functions for the chains that are connected to it:

* Security and immutability for the (para)chains that are connected to it. This is the main reason for projects to want their chains to be connected to Polkadot. 

* A way for all the chains to relay messages between each other. A good example would be in transferring coins between chains without requiring an exchange.

For more detailed information head over to the [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/).

Polkadot is really important in the blockchain space because it solves the scalling problems that have beset smart contract blockchains like Ethereum. 

It solves this because rather than having the business logic in smart contracts all executing on the same chain and competing for limited resources, in the Polkadot network all the business logic exists on their own blockchains. Polkadot simply provides the network security for hundreds of chains that will connect and the scalling comes from the seperation of the parachains.

## How is this related to Totem?

Totem has been built from the outset with the intention of connecting to Polkadot to receive the benefits outlined above.

Although our App is running independently on our Totem Meccano Canary Network (Testnet), as soon as we win a parachain slot, this App will be able to connect directly to the Totem Parachain running on Polkadot. 

In order to do that the Totem team has to secure a Parachain Slot Lease. The cost of a lease can be in the region on `$50M-$200M` and no team is expected to have that spare amount of money available to secure a slot. 

Instead the slot can be funded by the community via a **_Crowdloan_**. 

**Simply put, Totem will need a Crowdloan in order to connect to Polkadot as a Parachain.**

## What is a Crowdloan?

The reason why it is a _loan_ is because the _crowd_ of people that fund the slot on behalf of the project team never lose their money - they get it back at the end of the lease period.

In exchange for this support, the project team typically grants native coins from their network to the contributors in the crowdloan.

It works roughly like this: for every `$` committed to the crowdloan, they will receive back more-or-less the equivalent `$` in project network currency. The great thing is that they will always get their original DOT contributions back after the lease period is over or if the team fail to win a slot.

Each team has its own Crowdloan proposition and Totem is no different. This document is Totem’s Parachain Crowdloan proposition.

Each team must take part in an Auction process to win a slot connecting to Polkadot. In order to bid on an auction, the mechanism uses the funds raised in the Crowdloan to make the bids - but you can be sure the team itself **_cannot touch your money_**. Polkadot does not allow this to happen.
