# Free allocations of XTX network tokens:

### All available coins not already allocated to _users_ and not accidentally burnt in the development process will be re-assigned to the Live Accounting Association address. This includes all founder allocations that were made at the genesis block. 

> In other words the Founders will give up their allocations on the TestNet in order not to skew allocations on the MainNet.

* The Live Accounting Association will make adjustments to existing usersâ€™ balances in the TestNet which will be carried over to MainNet:

    * Current users of Totem are already in posession of tokens from the faucet (circa $0.17) will receive a bonus of the equivalent of $25.

* The Live Accounting Association address will provide funds to the faucet.

    * New users will receive a faucet allocation of the equivalent of $25

    * Users can refer friends and will receive a bonus of  the equivalent of $10 per referred friend from the faucet.

        * The referee will aslo receive a bonus of $10 from the faucet.

        * A referee can only make a maximum of 15 referals per week.

> **All users signed up on the TestNet and who have actually used Totem Live Accounting will receive a 50x multiplyer when their balance is migrated to MainNet.**

**In the next section we provide information about paid allocations of XTX.**
