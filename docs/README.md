## Welcome to Totem Live Accounting Docs.

**In these pages you will find supporting documentation on the Totem Live Accounting application and other detailed aspects of the project.**

Here we expand upon concepts in the various modules of Totem, and explain the vision as we see it and how that relates to what we are building.

> Totem Live Accounting is a global peer-to-peer real-time accounting ledger designed for the gig economy. 

What that means is that accounting entries are posted directly into all independent partiesâ€™ accounts as soon as they are created by a transaction or a business event. The ability to conduct accounting updates with anyone, anywhere at anytime, closely matches changes to employment in the economy at large. More workers are being employed in the gig-economy and are becoming increasing reliant on peer-to-peer interactions.

With traditional accounting software peer-to-peer communication is impossible. In some cases competitors have tried to provide a similar solution but this always relies upon all parties subscribing to the same software. This rarely happens, and there are many risks and issues associated with doing this especially as the solutions are centralised and worse, you do not control your data. 

Totem innovates this because the protocol which we are building allows companies to share data without configuration securely, privately and without having to rely on a software vendor. Alongside the protocol, we are also building a user interface (aka UI) so that companies can use the Totem protocol immediately without having to build an interface themselves - although they could if you wanted to.

## The Concept of Totem Modules

In broad terms "a module" in Totem is an item that can be found in the navigation bar of the UI. It usually has two primary components: the front-end user interface (Totem UI) and the back-end blockchain (Totem Network).

## Supporting Services for each Totem Module

There are additional supporting components which allow your data to be stored locally on your device, and this in turn is supported by a remote service which syncronises your data with your device and the blockchain. 

In the UI itself there is a queuing mechanism that helps with sending transactions and synconisation.

All these services will be explained here too.
