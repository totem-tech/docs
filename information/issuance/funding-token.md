# LEGO Seed Funding Token

### Because we know that users like to own free market tokens we are issuing a special token on the network called the Totem Seed Funding Token (ticker symbol: LEGO) with a **_very_** limited supply.

> **The token supply will be limited to only 1618.03398875 LEGO tokens.**

The allocation of these tokens will be as follows:

### 20% to Current and future team

The purpose of the fundraising is to grow the team and accelerate development towards the MainNet launch. We will need to allocate some of these funds to new team members and incentive programs such as bounties and bug bounties.

### 80% to Community of which:

* 55% for sale in this seed round.

    * Minimum Order 1 LEGO 

        * Transfers be made for smaller amounts

        * Transfers must be paid for using TOTEM

    * Price per LEGO $5000.

    * Chainlink is the primary Oracle for exchange rate determination used at time of investment.

    * On MainNet launch, LEGO holders will burn tokens to acquire MainNet currency (symbol: TOTEM).

    * the market price of LEGO will determine the quantity of TOTEM tokens minted in the burn - and this in turn will determine the initial supply on MainNet.

    * As TOTEM has a stable value the mechanism of burning will ensure that the owner receives a 98% discount of the market price at burn time. This will also increase the supply on MainNet. (See the next secion for more details about **_The Burn_**)

        * The burn period will be time limited. 
        
        * After burn deadline, tokens can only be burned at the last market price on the deadline.

### Remaining 25% distributed as follows:

* 20% Live Accounting Association Reserve (subsequent rounds/exchange 
listing).

* 3% Referrals Promotions and Airdrops.

* 2% Polkadot Community Teams.

In the next secion we discuss the details about **_The Burn_**.
