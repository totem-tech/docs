### Step 2 - Rename the Default Identity.

When you first connect with Totem, a unique Identity is created for you. 

You will be asked to replace the “**Default**” name with a name you choose. You can change this at any time, and it does not affect anything that you have done in the past.

Everything you need to know about [**Identities**](app-docs/identities/identities.md) can be found in that section.
