## Visibility of data associated with an Identity

> All the functionality inside the Live Accounting App is attached to whichever Identity is selected at the time.

In this way accounting entries cannot be accidentally posted to the wrong Identity. Your accounts are separated both in the app, on the blockchain and everywhere else.

* You can only select one Identity at a time from the drop-down menu in the header bar. 
    - For example when you create an Activity in the Activities Module it will appear in a table. 
        * The table is associated by the Identity that was selected when the you created the Activity. 
        * It cannot be displayed by any other selected Identity, even if you own those other Identities.

**Pro tip: If you are expecting to see an entry in a table and it's not there - _check you have the correct Identity selected!_**

* You can create as many Identities (personas or businesses) as you like. 

* It is considered good privacy practice to create a new Identity each time you are going to share one. 
    - When you are starting to learn Totem we do not recommend you do this, until you are comfortable with the concept.

> There are a couple of exceptions to this rule. 

* Both the Identities Module and the Partners Module show all Identities and Partners, no matter which I dentity is selected.

* The History Module shows the history of the Live Accounting App. This is private. Totem cannot see this history, but it is useful should you need to contact support via the chat messaging.
