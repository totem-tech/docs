### An Identity in Totem Live Accounting can be a business, but it can also be a persona.

> We have purposely left the definition vague. How you use Identities depends on how simple or complex your use case is.  

Identities are flexible enough to be used in any way you want to organise and store your accounting information.

For example when Live Accounting is used in larger businesses, the Identity is usually a cost-center, profit-center or budget holder. These are more complex administrative use-cases that will be familiar to anyone who has ever worked in the corporate world. 

For smaller businesses you may just want to have one Identity that deals with all your accounting for that business.

Although Totem Live Accounting is "enterprise ready" by design it works just as well even if you are just a startup.
