# Terms & Conditions

In order to use Totem Live, you must agree to the following terms which protect you from bad things happeneing. We have tried to make them simple.

## Rule #1

#### **Your data is your own. We do not store it. We cannot recover it for you.**

Because we value your privacy, everything you create is primarily stored on your device and on the blockchain and on decentralised storage.

This means that **you must backup your data regularly**, and we provide a means to do that. It will allow you to recover the information on another device.

The backup is not currently encrypted, and we expect to deliver that functionality in the coming months.

## Rule #2

#### **Your keys, your money.**

We do not have access to your keys. 

This means that we cannot steal your money, but it also means that we cannot help you if you lose your keys. 

**You must never share your data or access or backups with anyone else.**

We recognise that it is very hard to manage your own keys and we will be releasing a social recovery mechanism and multi-signature accounts to help you manage this in the coming months.

## Rule #3

#### **The software is currently under heavy development and is considered a so-called "alpha" product.**

In practice this means there are no guarantees that it is either bug-free or fully fit for purpose, but we do expect that you should report all issues that you find - this will help us fix them!

The software is highly experimental, nothing like this has been done before and whilst we will try our best not to break things, in a product like this, things might break unexpectedly. There are no guarantees that we can fix the problems in a timely way, so proceed with caution.

## Rule #4

#### **Do not rely on the alpha product for mission critical uses**

This should go without saying, but there - we said it. An alpha product may encounter difficulties that require the network to be reset. You will risk losing all the data stored on the blockchain in this situation, and it may not be possible for us to replay the last blockchain state or the correct history.

Having said that, we have encountered this situation during our development and have been able to recover with only a few blocks lost. We try our best.
