## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Can I sell XTX after the Crowdsale?

**Yes.** 

You will be able to sell up to 162% of your contribution value after the Crowdsale. Depending on which level you acheived some of your allocation maybe be locked until MainNet Launch. See the Schedules for details.

We already have the basis for a cross-chain OTC Marketplace available in Totem Live, and we hope it will be completed shortly after the Crowdsale. This will allow you to exchange XTX for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dots and possibly other cryptocurrencies.

It does not preclude exchanges from listing XTX.

### 2. Can I get free tokens?

**Yes.** 

A limited supply of free tokens is available from our faucet **before the Crowdsale starts**. There are several ways to obtain them:

**Refer a friend.** 

If your friend signs up they will automatically receive the standard sign-up allocation plus a small bonus. You will also receive a bonus for referring. 

**Using Totem**

Totem is designed to be used. If you use Totem for tasks, activities and timekeeping as well as payments, your account will receive an additional bonus allocation of XTX on MainNet. The more you use Totem the greater the allocation on MainNet. Remember the Developers will not be holding XTX and the idea is that the majority of XTX must be distributed to the community. So get to work!

### 3. Are there any hidden benefits?

* **3.1** If you receive funds from the faucet and use these funds to work with Totem, then you will receive an allocated on MainNet and an automatic Level 8 Multiplier.

* **3.2** If you receive funds from the faucet and do nothing, then no matter how large your balance, no funds will be allocated on MainNet. HODLing serves no purpose in Totem as the price is deterministic.

* **3.3** If you receive funds from the faucet and attempt "simulate usage" for example by only transfering funds between identities you will receive zero allocations of XTX on MainNet.

### 4. Are HODLers penalised?

**Yes, no, it is contingent.**

We want to encourage people to use Totem because it helps us define what the market wants. So we have a couple of rules that determine how your funds migrate to MainNet:

* **4.1** If you receive funds from Crowdsale, and actually use Totem, then this will cause your balance to be reduced. To make up for this you will be recompensated in MainNet with an additional bonus based on the amount of usage on top of your original allocation. This is to be decided.

    * **4.11** A cut-off period will come into play to determine the account activity and the amount of XTX that will be allocated on MainNet. This will be notified in advance.

* **4.2** If you receive funds from Crowdsale, and do nothing, you will be allocated the same quantity of XTX on MainNet.

* **4.3** If you receive funds from Crowdsale, and sell some, but do no other activity in Totem you will be allocated the remaining quantity of XTX on MainNet.


### 5. Is this an Initial Parachain Offering?

Although Totem is part of the Polkadot Ecosystem, a so-called Initial Parachain Offering is designed to lock funds for the _contributors_ and not the developers. This is a funding round is designed to grow the team and accelerate development towards MainNet.

Having said that, we will be encouraging the Polkadot Community to appraise the project against other projects in the space and invest in our parachain auction slot when the time is right. This will only be after Totem Live Accounting's MainNet launch.

### 6. How many confirmations?

With any cryptocurrency payment, there are factors that can mean that your funds are not immediately allocated, perhaps because the funds were not included in a block in a timely manner.

In our registration form you will be required to click to confirm that funds have been sent and from that point on we will monitor the blockchains for your funds. This is an automated process and your funds should be credited within 24 hours following at least 12 confirmations on any network. 

If your funds are not credited after 24 hours, you can trigger a further manual status check in the registration form.

### 7. What happens if I pay after the Crowdsale is closed?

You contributions will be counted, but you will not achieve multiplier levels, no matter how much you have contributed. It will be allocated at the base allocation level for the cryptocurrrency you paid with.

### 8. When will my total allocations be calculated?

Mostly this will be in the 

### 9. Can I pay with Fiat?

**No.**

### 10. Is there a maximum contribution?

**Yes**

the maximum contribution is determined by the maximum number of XTX that is available for allocation. This is known as the Crowdsale Cap.

* **10.1 How much is the Crowdsale Cap?**

> The Crowdsale Cap is equivalent to $100M in XTX or XXXXXXXXXXXX.

We do not expect this to be reached, and in any case the remaining funds will not be carried over to MainNet.

### 11. Can I invest more than the Level 8 Multiplier?

**Yes**
