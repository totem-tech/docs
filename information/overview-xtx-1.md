# How many tokens will be issued?

### This is very often a major consideration when assessing the potential future value of a cryptocurrency, especially if the cryptocurrency is intended to be traded on a public exchange. 

It is generally assumed that the exchange rate and growth of value are affected by the quantity of currency in circulation, the demand on the exchanges, and how much of the currency is owned by the founding team, and how much is available to the public.

However, if you have read the previous pages on the subject, it should be clear that the Live Accounting Network token value _is designed to be disconnected from the quantity of currency available_ to the system. This is an important distinction, because it means that the value of the tokens held by the early adopters is designed to move relative to all other assets. **_It provides a level of certainty that cannot be acheived with market-price driven cryptocurrencies._**

Having said that we recognise that the participants and investors in the cryptocurrency space are interested in tokens that have a market price.

For this reason we are issuing a very limited quantity of free-floating market price tokens which will be used to determine the initial quantity of tokens to be minted on the MainNet.

In addition we will not ignore our existing users and early adopters on the TestNet and will also reward them when we migrate their balances to MainNet.

The calculation at the time of writing is subject to change depending on the level of investment and adoption but in principle these are the plans:

## Free allocations of XTX network tokens:

* All available coins not already allocated to _users_ and not accidentally burnt in the development process will be re-assigned to the Live Accounting Association address. This includes all founder allocations that were made at the genesis block. 

> In other words the Founders will give up their allocations on the TestNet in order not to skew allocations on the MainNet.

* The Live Accounting Association will make adjustments to existing users’ balances in the TestNet which will be carried over to MainNet:

    * Current users of Totem are already in posession of tokens from the faucet will receive a bonus of the equivalent of $25.

* The Live Accounting Association address will manage the faucet.

    * New users will receive a new faucet allocation of the equivalent of $25

    * Users can refer friends and will receive a bonus of  the equivalent of $10 per referred friend from the faucet.

    * The referee will aslo receive a bonus of $10 from the faucet.

    * A referee can only make a maximum of 15 referals per week.

> **All users signed up on the TestNet and who have actually used Totem Live Accounting will receive a 50x multiplyer when their balance is migrated to MainNet.**

## Paid allocations of XTX network tokens:

**There are currently no plans to issue XTX tokens in exchange for fiat or cryptocurrencies.**

However, as this is a blockchain network we cannot prevent exchanges from listing XTX, so you may end up being able to obtain XTX via an exchange.

> Users should be aware that there are risks in buying XTX on the market at anything other than the official network exchange rate.

## sTFT Seed Funding Token

Because we know that users like to own free market tokens we are issuing a special token on the network called Totem Seed Funding Token (ticker symbol: sTFT) with a very limited supply.

> **The token supply will be limited to only 1618.03398875 sTFT tokens.**



The allocation of these tokens will be as follows:

* 20% to Current and future team

* 80% to Community of which:

    * 55% for sale in this seed round.

    * Minimum Order 1 sTFT.

    * Price per sTFT $5000.

    * Chainlink is the primary Oracle for exchange rate determination used at time of investment.

    * On MainNet launch, sTFT holders will burn tokens to acquire MainNet currency (symbol: XTX).

    * the market price of sTFT will determine the quantity of XTX tokens minted in the burn - and this in turn will determine the initial supply on MainNet.

* As XTX has a stable value the mechanism of burning will ensure that the owner receives a 98% discount of the market price at burn time. This will also increase the supply on MainNet. (See below for more details about The Burn.)

* The burn period will be time limited. After burn deadline, tokens can only be burned at the last market price before the deadline.

* Remaining 25% distributed as follows:

* 20% Live Accounting Association Reserve (subsequent rounds/exchange 
listing).

* 3% Referral and Airdrops.

* 2% Polkadot Community Teams. 

## The Burn 

The intention is that sTFT holders will become the liquidity providers for the MainNet. 

The amount of XTX created on MainNet is allocated as follows:

> **Quantity Minted By Burn + Early Adopter Migration Bonus** is the equivalent of 49%.
>
> **Network Treasury Allocation** is the equivalent of 51%.

### Quantity Minted By Burn Calculation

| Calculation                             |               |                |  |                        |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|--|------------------------|
| The deterministic exchange rate for XTX | multiplied by | 0.02           | = | Discount Price           |
| Market Price of sTFT                    | divided by    | Discount Price | = | Quantity Minted By Burn |


### Early Adopter Migration Bonus Calculation

This will be programmed into the genesis block.

| Calculation                             |               |                | |                         |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-|-------------------------|
| Totem User’s TestNet XTX balances | multiplied by | 50 | = |         Early Adopter Migration Bonus           |

**Note:** The Live Accounting Association will not migrate the balance of tokens from 

### The Network Treasury

This will initially be controlled by the Live Accounting Association, and will later be community owned. The treasury is intended to be the liquidity provider of last resort in the initial startup phases of MainNet. The funds will be used to provide liquidity to users, if the holders of burnt supply refuse to provide liquidity to commercial users. It is intended as a safety mechanism.



<!-- ## Founders Allocations

**To address concerns about founders owning too many tokens or the possibility of dumping currency the following background facts should be considered:**

* In the current TestNet all tokens were created when the network was born in April 2019.

    *  The initial quantity of tokens was 250,344,418,537,487 of the smalles units. _e.g. 2,503,444.18537487 units if measured in the same way as bitcoin with 8 decimal places._
        
        * we refer to 100 000 000 units of XTX as a 1 Batch (bXTX)  
        
        * at the time of minting these tokens had zero value.

    * In the TestNet the tokens are consumed/burnt with transaction fees.

        * at the time of writing there are  250,344,321,419,820 units left.

    * **The Issuance in the funding round is 100,000 batches (10,000,000,000,000 XTX)**

        * This Issuance is equivalent to around $3.5M at the current exchange rate.

        * The Live Accounting Association may increase the issuance cap if the funding round is over-subscribed.

    * **Founders will receive a long-term locked allocation of XTX.**

        * These funds will be allocated according to the table below.

        * These funds will be not be available until the MainNet is shipped.

---

* The entirety of available tokens will be passed to the Live Accounting Association address "**5FNn3K99K9xz4N96AGNnpa8M9bRzyZ3SriQVZUafoq1GEogY**" on the Totem Meccano Canary TestNet.

    * This address can be inspected on the network at any time.

    * This address will send transactions to a faucet (for distribution) and a lock/burn escrow account for the remainder of the tokens.

* The Live Accounting Association will distribute the tokens in exchange for contributions, or via the faucet, or via developer grants.

---

**It is expected that token holders can sell their tokens, on the Totem Live Accounting Network OTC Marketplace when it is shipped after the Crowdsale.**

* We cannot stop centralised exchanges from listing the token, but it should be noted that the market price of XTX will not necessarily be the same as the deterministic price calculated according to the method described in the prior pages.

* Totem Founders will have their tokens locked for the longest period.

    * All other owners will be able to sell their tokens before the Founders.

> The aim of the Live Accounting Association is to distribute up to 51% of XTX on MainNet to the community with the remainder being allocated to the Treasury of the network, early adopters and Contributors.

### Important Note:

The network treasury is intended to be a liquidity provider of last resort, in the event that XTX holders refuse to sell to users.  -->

**In the next section we look at the likely consumption scenarios.**
