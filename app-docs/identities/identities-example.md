## Example of Identity usage

> Tom is starting a healthy cat-food company. He has a Totem Identity for himself "Tom", but now he wants to set one up for his business. 

**In Totem you are not required to officially incorporate a business to start using the software to conduct business activities.**

We call this concept "The Freedom to Trade Principle" and here's our reasoning:

_Tom doesn't know how his new venture will work out._ It's useful to him that he can create a new business and have all the accounting functionality by simply creating a new Identity. He can try out his new business but, if it doesn't work out he can stop doing it quickly and he will not have lost money registering the business and dealing with its closure. 

Later when his business is proven he can incorporate and the pre-incorporation accounts are already prepared automatically.

---

Tom creates an Identity and calls it "Tom's Healthy Cat Food Co.".

Tom can switch between this new Identity and his own personal Identity by simply using the dropdown menu in the header bar at the top right hand corner of the screen.
