# Announcing the Totem Parachain Slot Auction.

### Totem Live Accounting Team is excited to announce that after more than two and a half yearâ€™s development in the Polkadot Ecosystem, we are ready for our Crowdloan offering for the upcoming Polkadot Parachain Slot Auctions.

If you have never heard of Totem Live Accounting before, feel free to browse the documentation links in the sidebar and visit our Test Network App in the navbar above. Although this is running on our testnet, as soon as we win a slot, this App will be able to connect directly to the Totem Parachain running on Polkadot. Totem is one of the most complex applications running anywhere in blockchain space.  
 
## Participating in the Parachain Slot Auction

Participating in the **Totem Parachain Slot Auction** is a great opportunity for early adopters and for fans of Polkadot - not only do you get to keep the DOTs you commit but you also get an equivalent value in KAPEX coins from Totem. At the very least you will double your holding value if Totem wins a parachain Slot auction slot - and if not you get your DOT returned to you by the Polkadot Chain. **It's really that simple and really that safe.**

You will find an overview of the offering below and you can follow how to take part in the instructions available the [Links](#Links) section below. 

### Bonus Offering 

As none of the DOTs commited to the Parachain Slot Auction go to the development team, we are also offering a special enhanced commitment program that will help fund the launch of the Totem Live Accounting Mainnet and accelerate our path to market. The good news is _you don't have to pay anything now_ because we are simply asking you to pledge to fund that process and will ask you to make good on that pledge and claim your bonus when the parachain Slot auction succeeds.

### Already a Totem Meccano User?

If you have received funds from our Totem Testnet Faucet on the Meccano Network, you will automatically receive an allocation of KAPEX on the Polkadot Parachain. However, these funds are only claimable when Totem secures a parachain slot. We will provide instructions for you to do that once the slot is secure. Before this happens we will put Totem Meccano into "Maintenance Mode" to lock the current state of balances.

Any Balances that are not claimed by the deadline will be rolled back into the KAPEX treasury.


## The Parachain Pledge [aka Totem Network Crowdfunding]

You can chose to pledge up to 10% of the quantity of DOT committed in the Parachain Slot Auction into our Crowdfund and as a reward for supporting the development team you will be able to claim a bonus multiplier of KAPEX based on the sum total amount you commited in the Parachain Slot Auction _and_ the amount you pledged in the Crowdfund. 

### Here's how it works:

* If you only commit to the Parachain Slot Auction (Crowdloan) you will receive **40x** the quantity of DOT in **Totem KAPEX**.

You can stop at this point if you do not want to take part in **The Pledge**.

* By pledging an amount of DOT in the Crowdfund, you will be able to claim a multiplier of Totem KAPEX calculated as follows:

> **Ratio of commitments**:
>
> Total quantity of DOTs pledged in Crowdfund / Total quantity of DOTs committed in Parachain Slot Auction

> **Total DOTs**:
>
> Total quantity of DOTs pledged in Crowdfund + Total quantity of DOTs committed in Parachain Slot Auction

> **Multiplier**
>
> Total DOTs * (1 + Ratio of commitments) * 40

## Conditions of Participation

These conditions apply where relevant to either the Crowdloan or the Crowdfund or both. **If you chose to participate in both the Crowdloan and the Crowdfund, you must use the same Polkadot address for both actions** so that your KAPEX award can be calculated and awarded. We cannot make bonus calculations if you use separate addresses.

**Crowdloan Limits**
> * A soft cap on the Parachain Slot Auction Crowdloan is set to $100M [approx 2.5M DOT]
> * A hard cap on the Parachain Slot Auction Crowdloan is set at $500M [12.5M DOT]

**Crowdfund Pledge Limits**
> * A soft cap is set at $4M for the Crowdfund [100,000 DOT]
> * A hard cap is set at $50M [1.25M DOT]

**Supply Limits**
> Maximum KAPEX allocation Parachain Slot Auction and Crowdfunding:
> * **55% of total supply of KAPEX**
> * **i.e. 550,000,000 KAPEX**
>
> * Total Network Issuance 1,000,000,000 KAPEX

**Commitment Limits**
> * For the Parachain Slot Auction there are no upper or lower limits for participants.
> * A minimum commitment of 2.5 DOT is applied for the Pledge.
> * The Ratio of commitment is capped at 10% per address. 
>   * There is no benefit to over-pledging but you will be required to submit the correct amount to make the bonus claim.
>
> _There are implied limits to participation proportional to the Crowdloan limits and the Pledge limits set out above._

**Lock Periods**
> * The DOT contributed towards the Parachain Slot Auction are locked for the period of the parachain lease and can be reclaimed thereafter.
> * KAPEX is awarded if the parachain Slot auction is won, and will be carried out on chain.
> * A transaction lock will apply to all KAPEX awards for a period of time following a parachain win. This will give the team time to generate the funds and apply it to the participating Polkadot addresses. 
> * Once the allocations of KAPEX have been completed, transactions will be enabled. 

## Example

In the following table, Column A has committed & pledged the highest amount but the lowest ratio of commitments, Column B has not taken part in the Crowdfund, and Column C has the lowest amount committed, with the highest ratio of commitment.

This should give you a good idea as to the KAPEX awarded for whichever commitment level you are prepared to make.
