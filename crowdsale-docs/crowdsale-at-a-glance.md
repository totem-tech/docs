# Totem Transactions at a glance

* Totem Transactions (Symbol XTX) is the native functional currency of the network.
* A functional currency in accounting terms is not the same thing as fiat currency or cryptocurrency. 
    * A functional currency is a unit of value used to measure assets and currencies in the book-keeping accounts.
* The value of XTX is calculated according to set accounting rules.
    * The calculation is baked-in to the protocol
    * The market price has no influence on this price calculation
    * The value of what you have is constantly adjusted to remain stable relative to other currencies
    * This is a fundamentally new use case for blockchain cryptocurrencies.
* Uniquely, this allows accounting records to be recorded with a functional currency that is global, non-fiat and not pegged to any one fiat currency.
* accounting in this way means that foreign exchange market price changes are nullified and dynamically accounted for.

Totem operates a new type of currency that is only useful when combined with accounting software. The type of currency has not yet been seen in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, but has been used in financial statements since the dawn of time.

You can read more details about why this is entirely different than any other crypto-currency here: [Special Properties of the Totem Unit of Account](/crowdsale-docs/overview-xtx.md).

Although the currency as described in the documentation has a primary use case as a Unit of Account for Financial Accounting, it is also a cryptocurrency and can be used to transfer units of value and therefore has the same properties other currencies.

> Totem Transactions have the symbol XTX and has 0 decimal places.

XTX’s primary function is the currency used to pay for the execution of transactions on the network

XTX represents a proper unit of account (or functional currency) within the
system for utility purposes such as invoice generation, settlement services and security.

XTX will have XX supply (any more details?)

XTX holders on the testnet are the liquidity providers to users of Totem Mainnet

XTX is not a floating price token. The network will be calculating XTX with a special exchange rate, an index calculation of XTX 

WIP Example: 5,000 dollars (half a BTC - plus a multiplier for the level of half aBTC getsme) might equal a whole BTC of Totem Token (10,000 dollars).
