# Paid allocations of XTX network tokens:

### There are currently no plans to issue XTX tokens in exchange for payments to Totem or the Live Accounting Association.

We are planning a Crowdsale but this will be based on our limited supply Seed Funding Token which you can read about in the next section.

## What if an exchange lists XTX?

As there is a public blockchain network we cannot prevent exchanges from listing XTX. You may be able to acquire XTX from any exchange that lists the coin.

Buyers should be aware that buying XTX on the market at anything other than the official network exchange rate may result in financial loss.
