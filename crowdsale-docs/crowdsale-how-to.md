For ETH, Totem  requires a whitelisted account for payment, in order to check the balance paid to the smart contract. The tokens issued by the smart contract on Ethereum are issued 1:1 with the ETH paid, and are intended as a counter. They are not intended to have a market price. The final balance will be taken as the token allocation * multiplier.
BTC DOT and KSM will have unique addresses per signup, in order to monitor the addresses. The final balance on these addresses will be taken as the token allocation * multiplier.

Step 4: After submitting the form, you’ll receive within 24-hours a Totem crowdsale account address (it will be specific to you and the crypto). You can execute payment to buy Totem xTx at any point during the crowdsale.
