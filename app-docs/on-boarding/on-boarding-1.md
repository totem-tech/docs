### Step 1 - Create a Chat User ID.

In the first step you will be asked to create a Messaging or Chat user account. 

The Chat user account enables you to have private conversations with other Totem Live Accounting users. 

#### Example

A Customer has sent you an Purchase Order (PO), but you think that there is an error on the Order. You can reach out to your Customer directly in the chat messaging panel.

You were able to have a brief online conversation and your Customer has agreed to fix the PO.

Even if you Customer is offline, when you begin the conversation, you they will see that you tried to contact them the next time they log-in to Totem.

In this way you do not need to send emails or use another text messaging app - everything can be done without leaving Totem.
