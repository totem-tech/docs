## What are Identities?

Identities are either businesses or some personal idenity that you want to create. We have puposely left the definition vague, because it depends on how simple or complex you want your identity usage to be. 

For example When Totem is used in larger businesses the Identity is usually a cost-center or profit-center or a budget holder. These are more complex administrative use-cases that will be familiar to anyone who has ever worked in corporate. 

Although Totem is "enterprise ready" by design it works just as well even if you are just a startup.

### Example of Identity usage

Tom is starting a healthy cat-food company. He has a Totem identity for himself "Tom", but now he wants to set one up for his business. 

In Totem we do not make the distinction of an officially incorporated business and as Tom doesn't know how his new venture will work out it's useful that he can create a new business and have all the accounting functionality by simply creating a new identity.

Tom creates an Identity and calls it "Tom's Healthy Cat Food Co.".

Tom can switch between this new Identity and his own personal identity by simply using the dropdown menu in the header bar at the top right hand corner of the screen. 

**All functionality of Totem are attached to whichever identity is selected.**

## Sharing Identities

You will share some of your identities with the outside world - another person or a business - but **by default your Totem Identities are private**.

> Totem knows nothing about the identities that you create, and no personal information is needed to create an identity.

It is important to understand that everything that happens in Totem is attached specifically to a single Identity. Each Identity is the owner of it's own actions. This is the key principle behind blockchain projects  - the idea that each identity is "self-sovereign" - in charge of it's own data.

### Visibility of entries 

* You can only select one identity at a time from the drop-down menu in the header bar. 

* When you create an activity, it will only be seen by the Identity that was selected when the you created it. It cannot be seen by any other Identity, even if you own those other Identities.

* You can create as many Identities as you like and creating a new one each time you are going to share it with a new company or a new other person is encouraged, but not essential. 


## Identities List

The identities module is a simple table of  identities that have been created on your device. They do not exist anywhere else unless they have been backed up and restored on another device by you.

#### Important message about Backups and Data Loss

If you do not backup your identities and your device is lost, breaks down or is stolen, you will lose access to all your data forever. Totem cannot help you recover lost data.

Please follow the backup instructions in the (Utilities Module)[Utilities]. 

### Name column

This is the name that you give your identity. Again, it is private and only known to you, but you can change it at any time. Best practice is to give a short meaningful name to each identity, and make it more precise with tags (see below). 

#### Retaining privacy when you share an identity

How you name your identity is your concern. If you do not want to share the name you give to your identity when sharing, you have the possibility to enter a nale that only the recipient knows.

### Usage column

Identities are intended for either personal or business use, and setting this parameter is mandatory when you on-board and when creating new identites. 



## Tags column

Tags are words or phrases that you can use to categorise the entries in Totem not just in the Identities Module but elsewhere. 

### Example 

Tom decides that he wants to create several identities for personal use, but wants to distinguish one from the other.

Tom creates several new identities, Tom 1, Tom 2, Tom 3 etc. With Tom 1 he wants to use this identity when he goes shopping. Tom 2 is used when he is sending or receiving money from his family, and Tom 3 is the identity he wants to assign as the "owner" of Toms Healty Cat Food Co.

Tom edit's Tom 1, by pressing on the Pencil icon in the Actions column of Identities. In the edit window he types "shopping" in the tags section. Pressing enter causes the tag to be recorded. Pressing the tab button twice highlights the "Update" button, and pressing Enter stores the change and brings you back to the Identities list.
