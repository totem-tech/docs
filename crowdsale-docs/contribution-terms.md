## Contribution notes.

In order to contribute to the Crowdsale contributors must register using the Registration Form in Totem Live. This is also the contribution management module that allows contributors to track the progress of their investment and distributions.

The following are the general conditions of the Crowdsale.

* All contributions are not refundable. Contributors are required to self-validate the amounts that they pay, and that the addresses that they pay are the correct payment addresses.

* Ethereum contributions share the same smart contract payment address, and will be allocated non-valuable tokens (0TX) to their white-listed address. These Etherem ERC20 Tokens are allocated on a 1:1 basis ETX/0TX. We use this as a simple ETH contribution counter for the whitelisted addresses and the tokens will not be transferable.

* All payments to the Ethereum smart contract via non-white-listed addresses are considered donations and are not entitled to XTX. However, any contributor can retrospectively white-list their Ethereum address on Totem Live to retrospectively acquire XTX. Only then can it be considered in the final tally, and allocation level.

* Contributors to the Crowdsale can pay in any of the listed cryptocurrencies. The total value of the contributions in all currencies determines the multiplier that will be applied.

* Contributors can select one or more available cryptocurrencies to pay with - you are not limited to your first choice.

* A Contributor can pay with any chose cryptocurrency at any time before the Crowdsale ends, and provided they have followed the terms set out here.

* Contributors cannot remove currencies once added. However we ask that you do not add currencies you do not intend to pay with. 

* All payments received after the Crowdsale ends will still receive XTX allocations but only at the Base Allocation rate for their currency. 

* The date on which this happens is considered "The Last Allocation Time" and is defined by the team after Crowdsale closes and their decision is final. 

* The XTX allocations will be available to view during the Crowdsale in the registration form. You are expected to view the form from time-to-time.

* The final allocation is only calculated after the Crowdsale ends in order to capture funds sent at the very last minute. We advise you do not send funds at the last minute because the registration form allows you to calculate your Multiplier Level and depends on funds that have already been sent and received to indicate how much you have tp pay to reach the next Multiplier Level.

* The Crowdsale locking terms are that some funds will be locked for periods depending on the final Multiplier Level you achieve, and according to the release schedule. 

* With the exception of the lowest Multiplier Level there will be a continuous release of your XTX every quarter for 12 months from The Last Allocation Time. The remaining balance at the end of the lock periods will be carried over to the MainNet.
