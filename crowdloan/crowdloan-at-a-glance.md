### What is KAPEX? I thought Totem had the TOTEM coin?

In simple terms, KAPEX is a market priced coin used on the Polkadot Parachain. On MainNet TOTEM will be an algorithmic stable coin as described [in the Token Economics section](information/overview-token) of this docmentation website.

The relationship is quite simple: at this point in time we do not know how many TOTEM should be available to the MainNet network. We do not want to penalise early adopters by setting an amount that is too large. Instead the parachain and the KAPEX coin will help us determine exactly how many coins should be available in MainNet based on it's market capitalisation of KAPEX at the launch of MainNet.

KAPEX will help us precisely define the economic model by seeing how costly transactions are using a market price coin and to measure the optimal starting quantity of coins for MainNet. This is the main justification for creating KAPEX as a market coin.

#### How will the coins be migrated from KAPEX to MainNet?
Holders of KAPEX will be expected to burn their holding in order to receive/mint their allocation of TOTEM on MainNet. In this way, the market decides the market cap and effectively how many Totem will get minted for MainNet. There will be incentives to burn the coins in order to bootstrap MainNet.

KAPEX holder today will be the liquidity providers to actual users on MainNet who will purchase TOTEM from these early adopters.

Shortly after launch of MainNet and provided it reaches stability thresholds, the developers will relinquish control in MainNet and Totem will become community owned and governed.
