### Contribution Details Table

This table shows the details on how the Multiplier Level affects the contribution. A rule-of-thumb is that the higher the level of contribution, the larger the Multiplier.

The Multipliers are calculated on total contributions in all currencies. The Registration Dashboard will perform this calculation for you, so that you can contribute multiple times in multiple currencies and see how far away you are from acheiving the nex Multiplier level.
