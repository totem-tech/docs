## About the Crowdsale

This page explains in detail the economic model for the Totem internal Functional Currency for participants in the Crowdsale. It's the Tokenomics information you've been looking for.

#### **tl;dr**

_Totem native currency - XTX - is a true Unit of Account because it is both the Functional Currency and is intrinsic to the Accounting Engine. This may be the first time this has ever been conceived or executed._

---

### 1. What is XTX and why is it different from other cryptocurrencies?

> XTX is the symbol representing "Totem Transactions" - the native currency of the Totem Live Accounting blockchain network. XTX has no decimal places so 1 XTX is the smallest unit available.

The network is connected to a User Interface (aka [Totem Live UI](https://totem.live)) which is at it's heart the most sophisticated cryptocurrency wallet you have probably ever seen at this time - more on that later.

**Performing any kind of activity using this interface creates blockchain transactions, which are paid for using the XTX currency.**

In this respect XTX is similar to a utility token, because it is consumed when transactions are execting. This is common in most blockchains, however in Totem, the transaction fees depend largely on the type of transaction that is being sent. 

Some transactions consume more XTX as the size of the transactions - measured in bytes - are larger that others. XTX is consumed at the rate of 1 XTX per byte, and the smallest transaction is around 139 bytes so costs 139 XTX to execute. 

> A balance needs to be struck between the total issued XTX currency and the global consumption demand for executing transactions. Stakeholders are not penalised. They control the entire liquidity in the MainNet.

To give you an idea about this, typically large global corporations have accounting databases that contains 1-4 billion accounting entries over the course of a year or so. SAP which makes corporate accounting software - by far the largest player in the market by transaction volume - has around 64000 corporate customers.

So the amount of XTX required to fulfil this requirement will be need to be sufficiently large to cover the transactions use case. XTX is not burnt in the process of executing transactions, but sent to the validators and treasury. This means that beyond a certain startup point the network should circulate currency freely, but those who participate in the the Crowdsale will be the initial liquidity providers. 

It will be their responsibility to sell XTX to new participants so the entire quantity of tokens will be distributed amongst those who participate in the crowdsale and the network treasury.

The network treasury is intended to be a liquidity provider of last resort, in the event that XTX holders refuse to sell.

### 2. XTX as a Functional Currency is a true Unit of Account.

A Functional Currency is the nominated currency that every business - large or small - needs to decide upon in order to measure how it is performing. This is also known as a Unit of Account. 

It is a single currency against which all transactions in other currencies are translated and is supposed to have a relatively stable value. **The businesses Financial Statements cannot be produced without the Functional Currency.**

To many reading this, the idea of a Functional Currency will be completely unknown - unless you are an accountant of course - but it is probably the single most important concept in business accounting: 

> A Functional Currency that is stable relative to all other currencies means that reporting results can be compared across years, between companies in the same country, and between companies anywhere in the world. It is the basis for understanding the value of every company on the planet.   

Having said that, a Functional Currency can be different from another type of currency - the Presentation Currency. 

The Presentation Currency is the currency in which the Financial Statements are presented. This can be different from the Functional Currency, often it is the same. A Functional Currency is also a [Unit of Account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_account).

### 3. An example that explains the usage, and importance of the Functional Currency as a Unit of Account:

* A UK company makes sales in the USA, but buys it's products from Japan and Europe. It decides that for convenience the Functional Currency is the USD. However it is submitting it's companies results in British Pounds - the Presentation Currency.

* All Sales are recorded in USD and under the accounting rules the Cost of Goods (i.e. the products that are bought) need to be recognised in the same period that the revenue is recognised. 

* At first when the products are bought in Japan and Europe the costs are converted at the exchange rate of the date of the settlement transaction. However this exchange rate is adjusted when the expenses are recognised. The exchange rate used is now the rate of the date of recognition. The values are converted to USD in both cases.

* All transactions involving Euro and Japanese Yen have been converted twice, at this point in time. The second exchange rate being the latest one that is used. This continues to happen every month until the last day of the financial year, when this day's rate is taken.

Clever observers will realise that there may actually be a gains or losses associated with the difference between when the settlement actually happened (in Euro and Yen) and when the expense was recognised in USD. So an adjustment for foreign exchange differences is made to the accounts to show this difference. That's a lot of adjustments to make!

* Finally when every end of period accounts are produced, a simple conversion is made from USD  - the Functional Currency - to GBP the Presentation Currency. The accounts are then published.

The simple solution to this accounting problem would have been if everybody just accepted USD as payment instead of Yen or Euro, then there would be no exchange rate differences to account for and the end of period Financial Statements would be a simple conversion from USD to GBP at the exchange rate of the period end. 

### 4. So how does XTX work as a Unit of Account?

XTX has an exchange rate that is derived from all fiat currencies and will have small variations on a daily basis. The exchange rate fluctuates in accordance with the fluctations in the official reference exchange rates, and so represents a common Unit of Account against which all currencies can be measured. This makes it an ideal candidate as a stable Functional Currency.

Therefore in Totem all accounting enries are recorded in XTX by default. The entres are made at the exchange rate of the moment of recognition and not the currency the transaction is made in. In this way all accounting entries are recorded directly in the Functional Currency as per our example above. This therefore makes it incredibly easy to produce on-the-fly reports in the Presentation Currency at any time. 

### 5. What about payments?

The beauty of cryptocurrencies is that they can be used to make payments. In addition to all the functionality described above, where XTX is used to pay for using the accounting functions, the last piece of this puzzle is the use to settle invoices. 

Although Totem will handle recording accounting entries when payments are made using the existing financial system (of course) at some point those accounts need to be reconciled with your accounts.

It is our view that businesses will inevitably realise that invoices can be settled with XTX because it has a stable and system-wide accepted value. 

Borderless payments are a fact with cryptocurrencies, but borderless payments and completely automatic reconciliation is a whole different level.

This is our end goal.

### 6. So what does owning XTX mean?

If you are still following, owning XTX means that you are a stakeholder in the network's success. The developers do not intend to own XTX, and we wish to distribute it all to the community.
