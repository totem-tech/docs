### Crowdloan Referral Bonus

To encourage hitting the Soft and Target Caps all Crowdlenders can refer friends and receive a bonus based on their friend's contribution

|                                       | Referee Bonus | Referer Bonus
|--------------------------------------|------------:|-----------------:|
| Referral paid in KAPEX based on referee contribution          |  5%         | 5% |

_Users who have been referred, must make a contribuition to the Crowdloan, to activate the referral bonus for themselves and the person that referred them. Referral only extends directly to the referred party and is measured by the referred partyâ€™s contribution. In other words the bonus does not extend or accumulate to the initial referer when the referee is themselves a referer._


### Soft Cap & Success Bonus

**If the Soft Cap is reached all users will automatically get a bonus.**

|                                      | DOT Qty     | KAPEX Allocation |
|--------------------------------------|------------:|-----------------:|
| Soft Cap for the Crowdloan           |  1,000,000  |  100,000         |
| Soft Cap for The Pledge              |  100,000    |  10,000          |
| Contributor Bonus<br />[Crowdloan Soft Cap Reached] |  10%           |  11,000          |

### Target Cap & Success Bonus

**If the Target Cap is reached all users will automatically get a bonus.** *

*_This bonus replaces the Soft Cap Bonus (or else you can think of it as a further 10% bonus on top of the Soft Cap Bonus)._

It is intended that if the Target Cap is reached, no more Crowdloan funds will be accepted, however participants will still be able to pledge funds up to the maximum permitted amount.

|                                      | DOT Qty     | KAPEX Allocation |
|--------------------------------------|------------:|-----------------:|
| Target Cap for the Crowdloan                | 10,000,000 |  1,000,000       |
| Target Cap for The Pledge              | 1,000,000 |  100,000         |
| Contributor Bonus [Crowdloan Target Cap Reached]  | 20%            |  220,000         |


### Payouts

**There will be four phases to the payouts:**

#### Phase I Initial Payout

This initial distribution will be based upon the total contributions in the Crowdloan as logged by the Polkadot Relaychain Crowdloan module.

This will be carried out after the Kapex chain goes live and transactions will be executed to distribute the funds directly to contributor's wallets.

Referral bonuses will not be payed at this stage, because the next phases are required to calculate the full bonus payout to contributors even if they were referred.




#### Phase II Pledge Contribution

The Pledge contributions will then be collected from all participants.


#### Phase III Cap Assesment & Payout

At this point all the necessary information is available to calculate and assess the Cap acheivements and contributor bonuses.

This is the payout for both the Pledge contributions and the final total bonuses earned by contributors including referral bonuses.
