# Regulation, The Howey Test and Swiss FINMA

In this section we detail the two most important considerations; the so-called **"Howey Test"** and **Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance** in relation to the Crowdloan and Pledge. 

In addition as the Live Accounting Association (Swiss Verein in formation), based in Switzerland is administering the Crowdloan and Pledge and must follow the Swiss Financial Market's Authority Guidance which is outlined below.

## The Howey Test 

The Howey Test which came out of the 1946 Securities and Exchange Commission Court Case  [Howey vs SEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_v._W._J._Howey_Co.) has become widely accepted as  being applicable to all cryptocurrency fundraising efforts since 2017. 

The purpose of the Howey Test is to determine if the Crowdloan and Pledge constitutes an "investment contract".

The Howey Test is set out in four parts. All four parts need to be passed in order for the distribution of Tokens to be considered an "investment contract" and therefore as a security. If one or more parts fail, then the Token _may not_ be considered a security in most jurisdictions.

If the Token is deemed to be a security (i.e. it passes all four tests), then the sale must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the USA, regardless of the country in which the Token sale occurs.

The four parts of the test are broadly:

* Is there an investment of money?
* Is there a so-called "Common Enterprise"?
* Is there an expectation of profits or returns on investment?
* Do returns rely solely on the efforts of others?

In the following sections we detail how these tests apply to this Crowdloan and Pledge. Please read this very carefully, and if you have any questions you may reach out to us on any channel for clarification.


### ANALYSIS 1: Is there an investment of money?

The Totem Live Accounting Meccano Canary Test Network ("the testnet") is a public blockchain network that has been live since February 14th 2019, and has been the backbone of all the development work that has taken place before and after it was launched.

The Totem Kapex Parachain Network ("Kapex") was connected to the Polkadot Network on 29th April 2022, but will not function until a decentralised auction has been won on the Polkadot Network. The purpose of the Crowdloan and Pledge is to raise cryptocurrency (Polkadot DOT cryptocurrency) in a trustless manner so that it can be used by the team to win an auction. The process of fund-raising in a Crowdloan is "arms-length" and cannot be controlled by the Totem team directly neither do they have access to the funds that are raised. This project is also public chain, but due to it's network relationship with Polkadot it is referred to as a "Parachain".

The Totem Mainnet ("Mainnet") has yet to launch.

All users who have registered on the [Totem Live App](https://totem.live) ("the Dapp") connect directly with the testnet and have been allocated cryptocurrency (or "coins") for free using our automated testnet Faucet since the outset.

The testnet does not depend on other blockchains such as Ethereum or Bitcoin - it is a completely independent network. 

The testnet currency are consumed in order to execute actions on the Testnet. For example to create Activities, Timekeeping and Tasks and to administer them requires you to spend the testnet currency to process these requests on the blockchain.

Furthermore users of the testnet since launch have also been able to request, with certain limits, further allocations of coins from the testnet Faucet without charge. This request is carried out from within the application itself. These additional allocations have been fixed at the same level as the initial allocation and have been distributed free-of-charge.

The allocations made to users will be conditionally carried over to the Totem Kapex Parachain Network as a reward for early adopters at a rate to be calculated. Users will be required to claim their share of the coins allocated for this purpose as they will not be paid directly. 

The network currency used on the testnet is a cryptocurrency that has never been intended to have a value determined by after-market exchanges. We are not aware of any exchanges that have listed this network coin nor have we made any application to have this coin listed on third-party exchanges.

It should be noted that as the Totem networks are permissionless blockchain networks, no party can prevent after-market exchanges from listing any of the currencies associated with the networks described here. 

Testnet Coins that are migrated to, and claimed on, the Kapex network will also have the ability to be migrated to the Mainnet in a future iteration of the project. 

No guarantees have been given regarding the launch of Mainnet. The intention however is that Kapex coins do not automatically migrate, but are intended to be burnt in order for the owners to receive an equivalent quantity of coins on the Mainnet.

The testnet currency has been designed from the outset to explore and research a value calculated deterministically by an automated algorithm as set out in our 2016 Paper and more recently updated. The algorithm determines the virtual value of the testnet currency is based on information available to the runtime of the test network.

The concept provides that the virtual value of the coin cannot be manipulated by external parties and allows accounting entries to be made with a Unit of Account of deterministic value rather than a currency of floating value. This primarily enables accounting operations to be recorded with the Unit of Account and not with a coin at market price.

This calculation applies to the testnet, and will also apply to the Mainnet, however the coins on the Kapex network will be subject to market pricing. 

The quantity of the the testnet currency allocated by the testnet Faucet is in accordance with the valuation algorithm described in [the documentation](https://docs.totemaccounting.com/#/information/overview-token-3?id=steps-to-calculate-totem-exchange-rate). At the time of the testnet start, for accounting purposes as a unit of account (i.e. not a valuation) quantity of 16181 coins was apprimately equivalent to 0.18 USD, and was used this way in order to determine what the accounting entry amount should be stated in the network currency not the fiat currency. 

This amount of coins allocated was thought to be sufficient for micro-business to conduct accounting operations and business activities in the testnet Dapp essentially for free for a meaningful period of time without requiring an investment of fiat or cryptocurrency funds.

In the case of a requested to replenish the testnet currency, the testnet Faucet allocated the funds unconditionally and for free although this process has been deprecated as of the 29th April 2022.

Whilst the testnet coins have been distributed by the testnet Faucet, the allocation of the Kapex coins for early adopters will be via a claims process to be decided. This will ensure that only valid users will be able to receive their migrated amounts.

The Crowdloan and Pledge will be administered by the Live Accounting Association (Swiss Verein in formation) (in formation), and the basis of the allocation of Kapex coins has been set out in the Crowdloan details in these documents. The contribution does not constitute or confer membership of the Association, which can be obtained seperately. 

The Live Accounting Association (Swiss Verein in formation) will set aside money received as a donation to enable the purpose of the Association, but will otherwise rely on the Kapex currency for funding.

> The purpose of the Live Accounting Association (Swiss Verein in formation) is to provide funding for the development of the Live Accounting Networks. Any developer - not just the Founders of Totem Accounting - can apply for grants from the Association for work that carries out the purpose of the Association.

* Founders and team will receive an allocation of Kapex from the Live Accounting Treasury.

* In future all balances will be transferred to Totem Live Accounting MainNet at a minimum of 1:1 ratio of allocation the Kapex currency.

#### Howey Test 1 Conclusion 

The first test is unlikely to be satified as the testnet cryptocurrency was distributed on an already live network via an already live application, for free and for a significant period of time prior the Crowdloan and Pledge. These coins are also claimable on the Kapex network.

Therefore on this point the testnet and Kapex currency does not qualify as a Security. Consideration must still be given to the other tests.

---

### ANALYSIS 2: Is there a so-called "Common Enterprise"?

As the testnet has already been developed and is already live, there is no requirement for the Contributors to the Crowdloan and Pledge to be part of a common enterprise in order for the project to be developed, launched or to succeed.

The Kapex Coins are unlocked for Contributors shortly after the Crowdloan and Pledge activates using the blockchain application itself.

Contributors can immediately use some or all of their testnet allocations claimed on the Kapex network to enable the application or to transfer to other parties as a form of an agreed settlement.

#### Howey Test 2 Conclusion

The second test fails to establish a common enterprise, as Contributors are participating after the application has been developed and available to use.

---

### ANALYSIS 3. Is there an expectation of profits or returns on investment?

There are three categories of testnet currency owners:

* Early users / owners who were allocated the testnet currency from the testnet Faucet and can claim Kapex currency on the Kapex network.

* Crowdloan and Pledge Contributors who are to be allocated Kapex currency as a function of their contribution amounts.

* Owners who are both of the above

For users allocated testnet currency from the testnet Faucet alone there is no expectation of profit. No publicity has ever been made to this effect at any time whatsoever.

The Kapex currency that is allocated by the Crowdloan and Pledge processed is allocated on a like-for-like basis plus earned bonuses which could be considered discount on the exchange rate.

#### Howey Test 3 Conclusion 

If the Howey Test was based on this test alone there would be a possibility that the discount allocation for Contributors to the Crowdloan and Pledge, and in the absence of prior free allocations on the testnet is considered a security, but this is not guaranteed for all contributors to the Crowdloan and Pledge. 

This test is therefore only partially satisfied and subject to interpretation.

---

### ANALYSIS 4. Do returns rely solely on the efforts of others?

In traditional so-called Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) often the project is just an idea. At the point of the ICO the application has not been developed yet, and may fail if the development team is not able to achieve their goals. In these cases it is clear that investments in ICOs would require others to do work in order to realise a profit or return.

The Totem Accounting development team has been entirely Founder-funded until this point and the project began some time in 2016. There are no external investors and never has been. 

The Totem Accounting development team have developed the blockchain network and the core functionality of the application before beginning a funding round. 

Potential Investors are in a vastly different position with Totem Live Accounting Application as they can make empiricle judgements about the team and its abilities based on what they have achieved and delivered to-date. 

The contributions they make are aimed at providing funds to further and accelerate the development of the remaining aspects of the Dapp and to begin the process of market adoption.

In essence Totem Live Accounting, isn't an idea any more. It's no longer even an MVP. It's a long way down the road to becoming a full product. 

Furthermore because the entire development is completely open source, any party can join the network, build their own applications and User Interfaces without having to rely on the founding team.

#### Test 4 Conclusion 

The founding team has already completed the work to enable the network. It is no longer dependent on their efforts to function or operate. However, it is dependent on their vision and credibility to accelerate the goal towards widespread adoption.

The network is already functional, the code is open source, and the documentation about the project aims are is in the public domain. 

These facts alone mean that the Howey Test is not satified that the enterprise relies on the efforts of others.

## Howey Test Conclusions

Long before the Crowdloan and Pledge, the testnet and Dapp became public and operational with the core functionality having already been built, launched and available to the public.

Furthermore the testnet currency has been issued and distributed for a significant period of time prior to the Crowdloan & Pledge for free. In a limited capacity this free delivery will continue as the Kapex network currency after the Crowdloan or Pledge completes using so-called "airdrops" for marketing purposes and community engagement.

The users of the testnet (and eventually the Mainnet) are not required to carry out work in order to give value to the coin as the value is and will be determined by an independent algorithm rather than a third-party market price. The Kapex network will have a market price currency.

The Dapp has almost entirely been completed by the developers prior to the Crowdloan and Pledge and can be used today although there are still many parts to be completed and added.

This analysis is subject to alternative interpretation however for the reasons set out above three out of the four tests fail and on this basis the three network currencies are unlikely to considered a security in the United States of America.

This opinion may change in future or should the legislation change.

# Swiss FINMA Regulations

Under the Swiss Markets authority Guidance (FINMA Guidance 04/2017), the Totem network currencies may fall under one or several categories of Token:

* A Payment Token
* A Registered or Unregistered Security Token
* An Asset Token

The categorisation is not mutually exclusive and can be cumulative.

A further categorization is possible, the so-called Pre-Sale or Pre-Financing of a project. In the case of The testnet currency which is already in circulation this categorisation is not applicable.

### ANALYSIS 5. Are Totem Network Coins Payment Tokens?

Totem network currencies are in the classic sense cryptocurrencies. They are intended to be consummed when transactions are executed on a blockchain network, and can be used for payments. The quantity of the network currencies that is consumed by a transaction depends on the byte size of the transaction and other technical factors including the type of accounting record to be stored on the blockchain.

However, unlike traditional cryptocurrencies the value of the testnet currency and the future Mainnet currency is deterministic, as it is designed to be used as a Unit of Account within the accounting engine. In this case the value that is recorded may not have any bearing on a specific blockchain transaction, and may not even be related to an asset that is held.

The Kapex network currency is intended to have a free-floating market value, and can be used for settlement.

#### Test 5 Conclusion

Totem network currencies are defined as a cryptocurrency and given the nature of the value calculation for the testnet and Mainnet currencies they will inevitably be used as a settlement currency although this mechanism was primarily designed as a Unit of Account for valuation and accounting purposes. 

The testnet currency and Mainnet currency and by implication Kapex network currency can be considered a Payment Token and is therefore not treated as a security in this context.

---

### ANALYSIS 6. Are Totem Network Currencies Utility Tokens?

By definition all three of the Totem network currencies are Utility Tokens whose purpose is to confer digital access rights to the blockchain network amonst other features.

#### Test 6 Conclusion

In this case the Totem network currencies exhibit missing properties that would otherwise class it as a security, for example to provide access to capital markets.

---

### ANALYSIS 7. Are Totem Network Currencies Asset Tokens?

Totem testnet currency is distributed on an existing so-called Test Network environment. The coins are intended to be migrated to the Totem Kapex Parachain Network when it goes live. 

The allocation is conditional upon the contributor to comply with the terms of migration, but in general balances on accounts will be migrated plus any additional bonuses earned in the interim.

The testnet coins are standardised and they are not intended for mass standardised trading.

Totem testnet coins have been self-issued since 2019 and although it has not been publicised, given the fact that a Crowdloan & Pledge is in progress there is an expectation of claims on the KAPEX Parachain Network for non-paying migrated from the testnet should a Parachain auction be won.

#### Test 7 Conclusion

Totem Network Coins may be considered uncertificated securities under the Swiss Stock Exchange Act (SESTA). Self-issued uncertificated securities in Switzerland are esentially unregulated even if uncertificated securities qualify as securities within the meaning of the Financial Market Infrastructure Act (FIMIA).

Totem Network Coins are not intended to be traded on the Primary [Stock] Market and therefore do not need to be regulated in accordance with directives in Article 3 paragrah 3 [Stock Exchange Ordinance] of SESTA.

The issuance of Totem network currencies are not analgous to Equity or Bonds and although FINMA has no direct responsibility in this area, the network currencies are not required to conform to the Swiss Code of Obligations and the Financial Services Act (FINSA).

### ANALYSIS 8. Other considerations under Swiss Regulations

#### Deposits

This issuance of Totem network coins in exchange for contributions to the Crowdloan does constitute a claim for the repayment of funds however the Totem team are not the custodians of the funds, the Polkadot network is the custodian and the funds are automatically returned to the contributors own wallet addresses without any actions required from the team. Indeed the team are unable to touch these funds, redirect them or otherwise control them in any way. The claim, if any exists, is between the original holder of the funds and the Polkadot network. The contributions are therefore not considered deposits held on trust by the team. There is no requirement under the Banking Act to require a licence.

#### Collective Investment Schemes

The funds collected by the Live Accounting Association (Swiss Verein in formation) with regards to the Pledge are not to be managed by third parties and are therefore is not a collective investment scheme.

# KYC and AML Regulations

In Switzerland in the case of utility tokens anti-money laundering regulation is not applicable as long as the main reason for issuing the tokens is to provide access rights to a non-financial application of blockchain technology (see Art. 2 para. 2 let. a no. 3 AMLO, FINMA Circ. 11/1 "Financial intermediation under AMLA" margin no. 13 et seq.).
