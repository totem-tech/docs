## Polkadot Contribution Schedules

This document sets out the planned distribution schedule for contributions made in **Polkadot DOT**. It is subject to change up to 24 hours before the Crowdsale begins, but will remain fixed thereafter for the entire duration of the Crowdsale.

The distribution is calculated on the three month moving average exchange rate for stability and for convenience, rather than external spot price accuracy.

As a side effect however, fluctuations in spot market prices can expose arbitrage opportunities between the  currencies used to make contributions. These opportunities can be used to **increase Multiplier Acheivements** and overall level of XTX allocations. Funds are not refundable once paid.

> **For more information about how to exchange XTX after the Crowdsale in the Totem Live P2P OTC Marketplace please read the Crowdsale FAQ.**

### 1. Contribution Summary Table

**This table shows the summary of in/out contributions measured in Polkadot DOT.**

As XTX has a stable value with respect to all other currencies including cryptocurrencies (as defined in the whitepaper), it is expected that these values will remain stable through to Mainnet launch, but for the sake of the Crowdsale they are locked. 

> Contributors can exchange XTX for other currencies earlier than Mainnet launch using the Totem Live Marketplace according to the Release Schedules.

### 2. Contribution Details Table

This table shows the details on how the Multiplier Level affects the contribution. A rule-of-thumb is that the higher the level of contribution, the larger the Multiplier.

The Multipliers are calculated on total contributions in all currencies. The Registration Dashboard will perform this calculation for you, so that you can contribute multiple times in multiple currencies and see how far away you are from acheiving the nex Multiplier level.

| Multiplier Level | Contribution     | Base Allocation     | Multiplier    | Total Allocated        |
|:----------------:|-----------------:|--------------------:|--------------:|-----------------------:|
| 1                | 0\.00666667 DOT  |  18,335,045 XTX     |  1\.61810000  |  29,667,937 XTX        |

### 3. DOT Release Schedule per Multiplier Level

This table shows the total overall XTX that can be released over the 12 month release calendar by Multiplier Level. 

> **This table is defined by the principle that the lowest level contributors are not penalised over the higher level contributors as only 162% of the contributed funds can be released prior to MainNet. A staggered release period applies at all levels above the lowest level.**

Remaining balances on accounts are transferred to MainNet.

An additional multiplier (exact value to be decided) will be applied on MainNet under the conditions outlined in the [FAQ - Are HODLers Penalised?](crowdsale-docs/crowdsale-faq.md?id=_4-are-hodlers-penalised).

| Multiplier Level | %age Released after Crowdsale | Released Amount     | Equivalent Released |
