### About Your Contributions. 

The contributions are received and administered by the Live Accounting Association. This organisation also administers the development grants in order to further the development of the Live Accounting Protocols and applications.

* **DOT Contributions to the Crowdloan are refundable** after the Parachain Lease period or end of the Crowdloan if the Auction does not secure a Parachain slot. 

* **DOT Contributions to the Pledge are not refundable once the Pledge Module is activated.**

* Contributors are required to self-validate the amounts that they pledge, and that the addresses that they are making the pledge from using the Polkadot browser extension. These addresses will be used to identify bonus recipients.

    * Contributors must manually check the addresses that are copy-pasted BEFORE making any pledges.
        * A simple way to do this is to check the first six characters, the last six characters and several consecutive characters from the middle of the address.

* A Contributor can contribute **at any time before the Crowdloan period ends**, and provided they have followed the terms set out here. After that time the Crowdloan mechanism closes.

* A Contributor can Pledge **at any time before the Pledge period ends**, and provided they have followed the terms set out here.

* All Pledges received after the Pledge period ends will not receive KAPEX allocations. 

* The Pledge cut-off date will be defined before the Pledge is deactivated. This will be known as "The Last Allocation Time" and cannot be appealed. 

* The final allocation is only calculated after the Pledge period ends in order to capture Pledges made at the very last minute. 

* When the KAPEX allocations are released and allocated, the funds will be available for transfer once the balance transfer lock has been disabled. Refer to the [Crowdloan FAQ](http://localhost:3000/#/crowdloan/crowdloan-faq?id=_8-when-will-my-total-allocations-be-calculated). 

* All bonus payments are set out in the [Crowdloan Details](/crowdloan/crowdloan-details.md).

### Dates

The Pledge start date will be announced at the same time as the Parachain Crowdloan. This may be subject to change but we aim to announce the exact date and time giving at least 72 hours notice. 

The Crowdloan end date will be programtically set in Polkadot. The end date of the Pledge may not be immediately available, but will be announced during the course of the Crowdloan.

The Pledge will run beyond the date of the Crowdloan for an estimated further five weeks from the date on which the Parachain Slot is activated. 

The actual running time of both the Crowdloan and the Pledge is defined by a number of blocks.

### Migration Allocations

Funds that are migrated from Totem Meccano will be carried out on a fair basis. If we notice any suspicious activity on Totem Meccano for example this includes but is not limited to using fake email addresses in the newsletter signup, fake or bot twitter accounts, gaming the distribution mechanism or adapting or resetting the testnet client UI your funds will not be migrated and you will be disqualified. You may raise a complaint on our social channels (Twitter, Discord or Telegram) if you believe that you have been unfairly blocked from receiving a migrated balance. Final decisions will be at the discretion of the Project Team.
